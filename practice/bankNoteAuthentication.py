# The 'Class' column is a categorical variable. It tells you whether a banknote is real or fake. For the sake of this problem, map the level 'Real' to 0 and 'Fake' to 1.

# The dataset has been divided into train and test sets and both have been loaded in the coding console. 

# The training data is provided here:
